# Pixel Art Maker

This was an early project, built completely with raw Javascript. It's a pixel art maker with a set of pre-selected color palettes, custom color picker, brush preview, and viewing window.

You can also click and drag across pixels to paint 'all' the squares with a single click.

More specifically, your pixel art maker should allow a user to do the following.

1. Start with a blank canvas of pixels.
1. Select a brush color from a palette of colors.
1. Paint the pixels on the canvas using the brush color.
1. Repeat step 2.
